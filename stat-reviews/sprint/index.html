<h2 id="i-introduction-background">I. Introduction &amp; Background</h2>
<p>The <strong>Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT)</strong>, published by Wright et al. (2015), was a landmark, publicly funded randomised controlled trial (RCT) that tested a simple but important question: would targeting a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of less than 120 mm Hg—rather than the standard 140 mm Hg—reduce cardiovascular events and mortality in high-risk, non-diabetic individuals?</p>
<p>SPRINT was conceived in a landscape of uncertainty. Previous trials had shown inconsistent results. The ACCORD-BP trial (2010) tested similar intensive blood pressure targets in people with diabetes but failed to demonstrate a clear mortality benefit. HYVET (2008) showed benefits of treating hypertension in people aged over 80 but did not address lower BP targets. Meanwhile, clinical guidelines varied widely. At the time SPRINT began, American and European recommendations diverged, especially in older populations and those with chronic kidney disease (CKD).</p>
<p>SPRINT was not only statistically well designed but also strategically scoped to address gaps left by previous studies. Its impact has been substantial—reshaping US guidelines and contributing to global debate on the optimal level of BP control. In this review, we assess the trial’s statistical and methodological rigour, highlight key findings, and explore implications for clinical practice and policy.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="ii-trial-design-and-methodology">II. Trial Design and Methodology</h2>
<p>SPRINT was a multi-centre, open-label, parallel-group RCT with blinded outcome adjudication. Conducted across 102 clinical sites in the United States and Puerto Rico, the study enrolled 9,361 adults aged 50 years or older with SBP between 130 and 180 mm Hg and increased cardiovascular risk, but without diabetes or prior stroke (Ambrosius et al., 2014).</p>
<p>Participants were randomised 1:1 to either:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intensive treatment</strong>: SBP target &lt;120 mm Hg</li>
<li><strong>Standard treatment</strong>: SBP target &lt;140 mm Hg</li>
</ul>
<p>Randomisation was stratified by clinical site, age, prior cardiovascular disease (CVD), and presence of CKD. Blood pressure was measured using the Omron HEM-907XL device. Notably, the majority of BP measurements were taken in an unattended, automated fashion—reducing white-coat bias. Wright et al. (2021) later confirmed that although some site-level variation existed, the vast majority adhered to this approach.</p>
<h3 id="inclusion-and-exclusion-criteria">Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</h3>
<p><strong>Inclusion criteria:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Age ≥50 years</li>
<li>SBP 130–180 mm Hg</li>
<li>At least one of the following: clinical/subclinical CVD, CKD (eGFR 20–60 mL/min/1.73 m²), Framingham 10-year risk ≥15%, or age ≥75 years</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exclusion criteria:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Diabetes mellitus</li>
<li>Prior stroke</li>
<li>Symptomatic heart failure or left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;35%</li>
<li>Polycystic kidney disease, proteinuria ≥1 g/day, or recent acute kidney injury</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="duration-and-early-termination">Duration and Early Termination</h3>
<p>Although originally planned for a median follow-up of 5 years, the trial was stopped early after a median of 3.26 years due to a clear benefit observed at interim analysis. This decision, while prespecified, raises statistical concerns about overestimation of treatment effect sizes—a well-documented phenomenon when trials are terminated early for benefit.</p>
<h3 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h3>
<p><strong>Primary outcome:</strong> A composite of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Myocardial infarction</li>
<li>Acute coronary syndrome not resulting in MI</li>
<li>Stroke</li>
<li>Acute decompensated heart failure</li>
<li>Cardiovascular death</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key secondary outcomes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All-cause mortality</li>
<li>Decline in renal function and development of CKD</li>
<li>Cognitive outcomes (assessed in SPRINT MIND)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="iii-main-results-and-findings">III. Main Results and Findings</h2>
<h3 id="cardiovascular-outcomes">Cardiovascular Outcomes</h3>
<p>The primary composite outcome occurred significantly less often in the intensive group:</p>
<p>$$
\text{HR} = 0.75,\quad 95\%~\text{CI} = [0.64, 0.89],\quad p &lt; 0.001
$$</p>
<p>This corresponds to an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of approximately 0.5% per year, or a number needed to treat (NNT) of about 61 over 3.3 years.</p>
<p>All-cause mortality was also significantly lower:</p>
<p>$$
\text{HR} = 0.73,\quad 95\%~\text{CI} = [0.60, 0.90],\quad p = 0.003
$$</p>
<p>Benefits were largely driven by reductions in heart failure and cardiovascular death. Stroke and non-fatal MI contributed less, and ACS events without MI showed minimal difference.</p>
<h3 id="renal-outcomes">Renal Outcomes</h3>
<p>In participants with pre-existing CKD, the rate of progression to end-stage renal disease or a sustained 50% decline in eGFR was not significantly different between arms. In those without CKD, the intensive arm showed a higher rate of incident CKD—largely attributable to haemodynamic changes rather than structural kidney damage (Hu &amp; Chang, 2021).</p>
<p>Importantly, these declines were mostly reversible and not associated with long-term adverse renal outcomes.</p>
<h3 id="cognitive-outcomes-sprint-mind-">Cognitive Outcomes (SPRINT MIND)</h3>
<p>SPRINT MIND, an ancillary study, examined whether intensive BP lowering reduced the risk of cognitive decline. Results showed:</p>
<ul>
<li>A significant reduction in mild cognitive impairment (MCI)</li>
<li>No statistically significant difference in probable dementia</li>
</ul>
<p>The composite outcome of MCI or dementia was significantly lower in the intensive group (SPRINT MIND Investigators, 2019). However, due to early stopping and underpowered cognitive endpoints, results should be interpreted cautiously.</p>
<h3 id="ambulatory-bp-measurements">Ambulatory BP Measurements</h3>
<p>The ambulatory substudy (Drawz et al., 2017) confirmed lower 24-hour, daytime, and nighttime BP in the intensive arm. However, clinic BP measurements overestimated the ambulatory BP reductions—raising questions about the applicability of SPRINT targets in routine practice, where ambulatory measurements are rarely used.</p>
<h3 id="adverse-events">Adverse Events</h3>
<p>Serious adverse events were more common in the intensive group:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hypotension</li>
<li>Syncope</li>
<li>Electrolyte abnormalities</li>
<li>Acute kidney injury (AKI): 4.4% vs. 2.6%</li>
</ul>
<p>While Wright et al. (2021) argue these harms were manageable, they are clinically important—particularly in frail or older patients on multiple medications.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="iv-critical-appraisal">IV. Critical Appraisal</h2>
<h3 id="internal-validity">Internal Validity</h3>
<p>SPRINT demonstrated high internal validity. Randomisation and allocation concealment were well executed. Most BP measurements were unattended and automated, reducing bias. Outcomes were adjudicated blindly, and loss to follow-up was low.</p>
<p>The decision to stop early was statistically justifiable based on predefined boundaries, but as with all early-terminated trials, the risk of overstating treatment benefit cannot be ignored.</p>
<h3 id="external-validity">External Validity</h3>
<p>Generalisability is more limited. SPRINT excluded patients with diabetes, prior stroke, significant proteinuria, and symptomatic heart failure. Representation of women (35.6%) and very elderly patients was limited. Frailty status was not well characterised.</p>
<p>Wright et al. (2021) argue that these exclusions were necessary to maintain a clean causal signal. This is methodologically defensible—but it limits applicability to broader populations, including many commonly seen in primary care or geriatric settings.</p>
<h3 id="interpretation-of-composite-outcomes">Interpretation of Composite Outcomes</h3>
<p>The primary composite outcome combined events of varying clinical relevance. Much of the benefit was driven by reductions in heart failure and cardiovascular mortality. Stroke and MI rates were less affected. This imbalance complicates interpretation.</p>
<p>A weighted or hierarchical approach might have provided a clearer understanding of the differential treatment effects across components.</p>
<h3 id="measurement-approach">Measurement Approach</h3>
<p>SPRINT’s use of unattended automated office BP measurements distinguishes it from routine care. The implication is that SBP &lt;120 mm Hg in SPRINT is not equivalent to &lt;120 mm Hg in traditional clinical practice.</p>
<p>This has led to widespread confusion and concern about overtreatment when applying SPRINT targets using manual or attended devices. Despite reassurances in Wright et al. (2021), this discrepancy remains a major barrier to translation.</p>
<h3 id="adverse-events-and-risk-benefit-balance">Adverse Events and Risk–Benefit Balance</h3>
<p>While the relative risk reductions are impressive, so too are the harms. The higher rates of hypotension, syncope, and AKI necessitate careful patient selection. Intensive control is not appropriate for all high-risk individuals—especially those with impaired autoregulation or at risk of falls.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="v-clinical-and-policy-implications">V. Clinical and Policy Implications</h2>
<p>SPRINT has profoundly influenced hypertension management—particularly in the United States. The 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines adopted a &lt;130 mm Hg target, citing SPRINT as primary evidence.</p>
<p>In contrast, European and UK guidelines remain more cautious. NICE continues to use a 140/90 mm Hg diagnostic threshold and 130 mm Hg targets only in select patients.</p>
<p>The key issue is implementation. Achieving SPRINT-like results in practice depends on how blood pressure is measured, patient selection, and monitoring for adverse effects. A target of &lt;120 mm Hg may be reasonable—but only when pursued with careful monitoring, preferably using automated or ambulatory methods.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="vi-conclusions">VI. Conclusions</h2>
<p>SPRINT was a well-conducted and influential trial that demonstrated clear cardiovascular and mortality benefits of more intensive SBP control in high-risk, non-diabetic individuals. While internal validity was strong, concerns remain about early stopping, external applicability, and adverse events.</p>
<p>Real-world translation requires attention to BP measurement method, careful patient selection, and shared decision-making. The trial’s legacy includes not just a shift in guidelines, but also a renewed focus on measurement fidelity, patient heterogeneity, and the subtleties of composite outcomes.</p>
<p>As Wright et al. (2021) note, SPRINT should be seen as a foundation—not a blueprint—for modern hypertension care.</p>
